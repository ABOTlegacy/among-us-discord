# Among Us Friendly Bot - BETA
**This is still in beta, so if you find any problems let me know.**  
My second Discord bot for Among Us.  
This bot mutes discord users according to what happens in Among Us.

## Features
* Mutes and unmutes players according to what happens in Among Us(Doesn't mute dead players).
* Multiple games can run simultaneously and ~~friendly with bigger servers~~ Haven't tested yet.
* Everyone can start a voice channel for their game to play with anybody. No need for special permissions on the server
* Among Us codes will automatically appear in the voice channel's name so you don't have to tell it whenever someone joins the voice channel.

## How does it work
#### Room
A Room is temporary voice channel that a user creates and owns until they leave it.  
A room has a maximum of 10 users and.
For how to use the rooms do: `!au help`
#### Client
The client must be used by the owner of a room.  
The client is used for the bot to know what's going on in the game.

#### Maybe in the future
* Only unmutes alive players when there is a meeting, ghosts(dead) players will remain muted till the game ends
* (after thinking about it, it's stupid) Discord users' color will be the same as their color in Among Us if they share the same nickname.
