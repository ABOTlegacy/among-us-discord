# A Discord Bot for Among Us
This Discord Bot mutes everyone in a voice chat between rounds. It gets data from the game by the packets sent to/received from the server.

### The bot's permissions
You can give it the "Administrator" permission, or:
* Give it the "Manage Channels", "Manage Roles" and "Mute Members" permissions
* In the settings of the voice chat you want the bot to mute people, give it the "Connect" permission like so: [Example image](examples/voice_chat_connect_permission_example.png)

### The "AmongUsDB.json" file (required)
A json file that contains settings about the bot.
Should look like that: [AmongUsDB.json](AmongUsDB.json)
